<p><h3>My Brother is one of the most important person in my life. He is caring, supportive and always ready to help me whenever I face any problem. We share many happy memories together, from playing games and studding side by side. Sometimes we fight over small things, but our bond always becomes stronger after that. He motivates to do better in life and teaches me valuable lessons through his actions. Having a brother feels like having a best friend and a protector in one person.</p>
<p>His Hobbies are playing Badminton and to travel.</p>
