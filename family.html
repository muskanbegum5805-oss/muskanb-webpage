Our parents take care of us and guide us in every step of life, while my siblings and I share love, laughter and learning together. We spend time with each other, celebrate festival and help each one other in need. My Family teaches me values like Respect, Kindness, and Honesty. I feel proud and happy to be a part of my loving  family, and I wish we always stay together forever.</font><b></h3></p>
